### ___Homework2___
>___At the entrance to the program, information is provided about passengers who wish to leave their luggage in the storage room at a predetermined time before midnight. In the first line, the number of passengers N is reported, which is not less than 3, but does not exceed 1000; in the second line - the number of cells in the storage chamber K, which is not less than 10, but not more than 1000.___

## ___Modul 5. Functions___
### ___Homework1___
>___Task1: Given an integer n, calculate n + nn + nnn.___

>___Task2: Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters
and displays all even numbers in between.___
### ___Homework2___
>___Suppose that we have a list of customers and we for
of a given client, its position in the list should be displayed
and count how many times it occurs in the list,
that is, for frequent customers (those who appear on the list
more than once) some discount applies.
Let's create a function that displays the positions of elements
(customers) in the list and counts (returns) the number
occurrences
In the main code, we use the result of the work
of this function to determine the situation whether there will be a discount for
this client.___
### ___Homework3___
>___Task1: The function of determining the number of vowels in a line.
At the entrance we have a line with a letter of the Latin alphabet.___

>___Task2: Write a function that outputs to the screen
formatted text below:___
```
“Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions
drown out your own inner voice.”
                    Steve Jobs
```

>___Task3: Write a function that checks if a hexadecimal number exists
the "lucky" number. A number is passed as a parameter.
If the number is lucky, return true from the if function
no - false.
A "lucky six-digit number" is a number in which
the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the second three
numbers For example, 123420 is lucky 1+2+3 = 4+2+0, and
723422 is an unfortunate 7+2+3 != 4+2+2.___
